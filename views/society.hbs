                    The creation of the atomic bomb and the ensuing time period after the initial creation of the atomic bomb led to great changes throughout American Society during this post war time period and throughout the Cold War. The initial creation of Atomic Bombs by the U.S. in the Manhattan Project and the eventual detonation of these bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki led to an Arms race with the Soviets over who could develop more nuclear weapons more quickly. The effect of Nuclear weapons during the Cold War Era on United States society was most notably reflected in the occurrence of The Red Scare as well as the emergence of the policy of containment and the idea of Mccarthyism. The emergence of Soviet Power with the rise of their nuclear capabilities led to the United States being very fearful of the Soviets ability to launch an attack on the United States. As a result of rising Soviet power, Communism began to spread throughout neighboring countries to the Soviet Union and began to take hold and become influential in both Europe and Asia. This spread of communism scared the United States and as a result Truman and other government officials felt it was necessary to support the policy of containment in order to mitigate the Soviet threat. Society during this time was very centered around the idea of preventing communism and anti communist ideals and society became very distrustful and suspicious. This fearful and distrustful period was known as The Red Scare. The Red Scare was called this because the color associated with the communist party and Russia was red, and during this time period many people were suspected of supporting the communist party which was seen as a very bad crime. Eventually the United States government decided to take action in a variety of ways. One example of this is Truman's executive order 9835 or the “Loyalty Order”. This order mandated inspections throughout the government to make sure all government officials were truly loyal to the U.S. This order preceded the rise of a new philosophy called Mccarthyism. Mccarthyism was a movement started by Senator Joseph Mccarthy who was the fiercest American Political figure supporting Anti-Communist behavior. Mccarthy used intimidation tactics to convict and accused many people of supporting communism and oftentimes falsely imprisoned people on false allegations. This resulted in a sharp division between the citizens of the U.S. and the government because the citizens could no longer trust their government to truly allow them the rights which they were promised in the constitution like freedom of speech and citizens never knew if they were truly free or being watched and controlled by the government at every step. The government created distrust and another layer of fear during this time, and these two events demonstrate how society in the Cold War Era as a result of increasing Soviet Power shifted to a largely divided and fearful society under the control of a powerful government which controlled the life of many citizens. Other societal developments during this period resulted from the ongoing economic change during this period. The postwar economic boom contributed to the creation of a consumer culture which expanded and increased economic prosperity during the time. This consumer culture also led to a baby boom which was highlighted by a mass movement to the suburbs. Families now had a largely structured lifestyle which was based around working and maintaining middle class suburb status. During this time was the rise of the two income family in which women also contributed to the family income in order to keep up with the expanding consumer culture as well as provide for their children. All of these societal changes are very historically important because they provide an example of how too fierce or overpowering government intervention can cause division and distrust amongst society and laid out a framework for future government officials to fix when responding to similar situations. The societal changes in everyday life for citizens are also historically important because they set out a path for the future and pushed towards a greater American Economy as well as started to push the idea that women could do the same important jobs as men and contribute to society greatly as a whole. This era started a vast change in American society which would be reflected in decades to come.
